    <p>Abraham Lincoln was born on February 12, 1809, in <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgenville,_Kentucky">Hodgenville</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodgenville,_Kentucky">Kentucky</a>, United States. His parents were Thomas Lincoln and Nancy Hanks. His family was very poor.<a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln#cite_note-lincolnbook-2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>Abraham had one brother and one sister. His brother died in childhood. They grew up in a small <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log_cabin">log cabin</a>, with just one room inside. Although slavery was legal in Kentucky at that time, Lincoln's father, who was a religious <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptist">Baptist</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/refuse">refused</a> to own any <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery">slaves.</a> </p>
    <p>When Lincoln was seven years old, his family moved to <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana">Indiana</a>. Later they moved to <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois">Illinois.<sup>[3]</sup></a> In his childhood he helped his father on the farm, but when he was 22 years old he left home and moved to <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Salem,_Illinois">New Salem</a>,<a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois">Illinois</a> , where he worked in a <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_store">general store.<sup>[4]</sup></a> Later, he said that he had gone to school for just one year, but that was enough to learn how to <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read">read</a>,<a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write">write</a> , and do simple <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics">math</a>. In 1842, he married <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Todd_Lincoln">Mary Todd</a>. They had four children, but three of them died when they were very young.<a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln#cite_note-teamofrivals-5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Abraham Lincoln was sometimes called Abe Lincoln or "Honest Abe" because of a legend stating that he ran miles to give a customer the right amount of change. The nickname "Honest Abe" came from a time when he started a business that failed. Instead of running away like many people would have, he stayed and worked to pay his debt.<a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln#cite_note-6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> </p>

    <p> Lincoln started his political career in 1832 when he ran for the IGA <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illinois_General_Assembly">Illinois General Assembly</a>, but he lost the election. He served as a captain in the Illin<a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia">militia</a> during the <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk_War">Black Hawk War</a>, a war with <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American">Native American</a>Native American tribes. When he moved to <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Illinois">Springfield</a> in 1837, he began to work as a <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer">lawyer</a>. Soon, he became one of the most highly respected lawyers in Illinois.<a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln#cite_note-7"><sup>[7]</sup></a><a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln#cite_note-8"><sup>[8]</sup> </a>In 1837, as a member of the Illinois General Assembly, Lincoln issued a written protest of its passage of a resolution stating that slavery could not be abolished in Washington, D.C.<a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln#cite_note-9"><sup>[9]</sup></a><a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln#cite_note-10"><sup>[10]</sup> </a> </p>
    <p> In 1841, he won a court case (Bailey v. Cromwell). He represented a black woman who claimed she had already been freed and could not be sold as a slave. In 1847, he lost a case (Matson v. Rutherford) representing a slave owner (Robert Matson) claiming return of fugitive slaves. After he moved to Illinois, he worked as a shopkeeper and postmaster. He rode the circuit of courts for many years. When he was 21, he worked on a <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatboat">flatboat</a> that carried freight. He joined the Independent Spy Corp. At first, he was a member of the Whig Party. He later became a Republican. Lincoln ran for senate against <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_A._Douglas">Stephen A. Douglas</a>. Douglas won.</p>
    <p> In 1846, Lincoln joined the <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_Party_(United_States)">Whig Party</a> and was elected to one term in the <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Representatives">House of Representatives</a>. After that, he ignored his political career and instead worked as a lawyer. In 1854, in reaction to the passage of the <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas-Nebraska_Act">Kansas-Nebraska</a> Act, Lincoln became involved in politics again. He joined the <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_(United_States)">Republican Party</a>, which had recently been formed in opposition to the expansion of slavery. In 1858, he wanted to become <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Senate">senator</a>; although this was unsuccessful, the <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wiktionary.org/wiki/debate">debates</a> drew national attention to him.<a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln#cite_note-11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> The

Among these reasons were that his views on slavery were less extreme than those of other people who wanted to be candidates. Lincoln was from what was then one of the Western states, and had a bigger chance of winning the election there. Other candidates that were older or more experienced than him had enemies inside the party.<a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln#cite_note-13"><sup>[13]</sup></a><a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln#cite_note-nationalexperience-14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Lincoln's family was poor, which added to the Republican position of <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_labor">free labor</a>, the opposite of slave labor. Lincoln won the election in 1860, and was made the 16th President of the United States. He won with almost no votes in the South. For the first time, a president had won the election because of the large support he got from the states in the North.<a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_labor"><sup>[14]</sup></a>During his presidency Lincoln became well-known because of his large stovepipe hat.

    <p>After Lincoln's election in 1860, seven States (South Carolina, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Texas and Louisiana) formed the <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America">Confederate States of America</a>.

Later, four more states (Arkansas, Virginia, Tennessee, and North Carolina) joined the Confederacy for a total of eleven. In his whole period as President, he had to rebuild the Union with military force and many bloody battles. He also had to stop the "border states", like Kentucky, Missouri, and Maryland, from leaving the Union and joining the Confederacy.<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Abraham_Lincoln_O-55%2C_1861-crop.jpg/375px-Abraham_Lincoln_O-55%2C_1861-crop.jpg" alt="2" align="right" hspace="20"> Lincoln was not a general, and had only been in the army for a short time during the <a target="_blank" href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hawk_War">Black Hawk War.<sup>[16]</sup></a>However, he still took a major role in the war, often spending days and days in the War Department.
